# CSC207 Project: Heardle Come Back!

## Problem Domain: Trivia and Music Discovery 
Music has always been an integral part of human culture. However, with an ever-growing catalog of songs worldwide, it's easy to get lost in the vast sea of tracks. The art of discovering new music or recognizing tunes from mere snippets poses a challenge, making it an exciting domain for trivia enthusiasts and casual listeners alike.

## Project Description
We are building a web-based application inspired by the likes of 'Wordle' but for music, called "Heardle". Utilizing Spotify's extensive API, our platform will play the beginning of a track and challenge participants to identify both the song title and artist within as few turns as possible. Our song selection centers around the most popular tracks streamed over the past decade. Players have six attempts, and with every missed or skipped guess, a longer portion of the song's start is revealed, extending up to 16 seconds. The ultimate goal is to pinpoint the track as swiftly as possible, ideally from just one second of the intro. 

## Features 
- **Daily Challenges**: A new song clip is available daily for users to guess.
- **Streaks & Leaderboards**: Keep track of how many games youâ€™ve played and the number of correct guesses. You can also share and post your results with friends or family. 
- **Music Discovery**: Post-guess, users can directly explore the song, the artist, and their discography on Spotify.
